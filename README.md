# usbCameraSNPE

This App integrates Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine(v1.8) along with USB Camera and OpenCV.

It needs a trained model converted with SNPE tool to dlc format aong with output vector map.
OpenCV is used for preprocessing the image (feature scaling rgb). Trained model can selectively run on DSP/CPU/GPU.
